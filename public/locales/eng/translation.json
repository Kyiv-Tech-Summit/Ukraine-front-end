But it is still a city of glory and pride of the entire Ukrainian nation \nIf you have not seen this ancient and at the same time eternally young and modern capital, you should definitely do it. And fall in love with it forever!"

But at the same time it was also a- place of science, art and sports. A city of mines, factories, combines, but also a city of million roses, ballet, football and gymnastics. This is the legacy of the majestic and unconquered Wild Fields."
